<h1>The Best Movies According to Amy</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Breakfast Club</h3>
<p>I love this movie because it floods me with memories from when I was young.<br/>
It hits all the feels of the different types of people in High School in that timeframe.<br/>
</p>

<h3>The Bridge to Tarabithia</h3>
<p>This one is a great fantasy and makes me cry every time i watch it. </p>

<h3>TBD</h3>
<p>I'm having a hard time coming up with a 3rd movie right now. <br/>
    I'll keep trying coming up with something. <br/>
    Keep on trying, that's what I'm going to do.
